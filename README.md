# Pitch-Voice-analaysis
In This repository, we have implemented the Voice Analysis for a pitch, and the model will extract a percentage of each emotion from the video (Sleepy, Angry, Surprised, Happy, Sad, and Disgusted). As well, it will extract the percentage of his English fluency from Low, Intermediate, and High.
The user should upload his pitch to Youtube, then he/she should copy the youtube URL video.
after running the app.py, the HTML page with some CSS design will be loaded at the localhost port 5500, so the user should go to the chrom and type localhost:5500.
The page will be loaded and the he/she will be able to use our platform.
They should past their youtube link in the edited text one, then they should press the extract features button.
after waiting some time (our program will need to download the youtube file and extract features wich might take time), the results will be shown under the fleuency logo and the emotion logo at the end of the page.
Feel free to try it and use IT!
